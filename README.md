Project Summary

This GitHub repository contains my project on the Juniata College men's basketball team, focusing on data from February to March 2024. I used Python and pandas to clean and analyze two main types of data: player stats and game performance.

Data Details

The data was pulled from "Juniata men's basketball.html" and split into two DataFrames: JMB_players for individual player statistics and JMB_games for game-by-game performance. I cleaned these datasets by renaming columns for clarity, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary information.

Cleaning Highlights

For player data, I converted numeric stats to the correct format, set player names as the index, and created a new variable to show the percentage of games each player started. For game data, I cleaned up opponent names to differentiate home and away games and introduced new variables like 'Field Goals Attempted' and game results.

Insights and Export

After cleaning, I documented each variable in both datasets and exported the cleaned data to CSV files: player_data.csv and game_data.csv. These are ready for further analysis or visualization.

Personal Reflection

Working on this project improved my skills in using pandas for data manipulation and reinforced the importance of thorough data cleaning for accurate analysis. I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects, possibly exploring more advanced analytical techniques.

Final Notes

The cleaned datasets are available for anyone interested in sports analytics or looking for well-structured data for practice. This project was a great opportunity to apply data cleaning and transformation techniques to real-world sports data.
